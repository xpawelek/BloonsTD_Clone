3. Click **Start Round** to send a wave of balloons.
4. Towers attack balloons automatically if they are in range.
5. Click on a tower to:
   - Upgrade it (if affordable),
   - Sell it for 90% of its cost.
6. If balloons reach the end of the path, you lose lives.
7. The game restarts automatically if all lives are lost.

## Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- JavaFX
- CSS for UI styling
- MVC Design Pattern

## Architecture

The project follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern:

- **Model**: Game logic ‚Äî towers, balloons, animations, wave handling, upgrades
- **View**: FXML and JavaFX UI components, assets (images, fonts, CSS)
- **Controller**: Handles user input, game flow, and UI events
